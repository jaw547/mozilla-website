    <p>The dogs pictured above are:
    	<ul>
    		<li>Junket</li>
    		<li>Guinness</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>

    <p>Junket is the cream colored dog on the left with his tongue hanging out. Guinness is the large Rottweiler on the top right. Both dogs now live with my mom, but Junket used to live with me. In this photo, I am walking both of the dogs when I was taking care of them over the summer.</p>

    <p>Dogs are really important to me. They are loyal companions who keep me consistent. I have to be home on time to feed them, have to wake up on time to walk them, and have to remember to take time to relax and play with them. I deeply miss having dogs with me here in <a href = "https://goo.gl/maps/LM6V9y2bjM42" target="_blank">Boston.</a> Life just isn't the same without my fuzzy companions.</p>
