    <p>The dogs pictured above are:
    	<ul>
    		<li>Junket</li>
    		<li>Guinness</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>

    <p>Junket is the cream colored dog on the left with his tongue hanging out. Guinness is the large Rottweiler on the top right. Both dogs now live with my mom, but Junket used to live with me.</p>
